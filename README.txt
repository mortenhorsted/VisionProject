The project is divided into three subprojects, one for each use case.

The following abbreviations are used:
	SGI: Sight glass with indicator ring
	SGG: Sight glass without indicator ring


UseCase1: Moisture and bubble detection. The device is monitoring a SGI, and outputting the yellow color percentage as well as the bubble intensity every second.

UseCase2: Bubble detection. The device is monitoring a SGI, but only looking for bubbles in the rear third of the glass area. The output is the bubble intensity within this area.

Usecase3: Bubble detection. The device is monitoring a SGG, while looking for bubbles within the whole glass area. The output is the bubble intensity within this area.
